## Holakittens instructions

Hey there!

Are you ready to make a super cute app featuring adorable kittens? Great! Here's what you'll need to do:

Use a language you're comfortable with (like NodeJS, Rails, or Java) to create a simple REST API with a single endpoint called /kittens. This endpoint should return the "kittens.json" data (or a similar version of it). You don't need to worry about storing the data - just mock it up for now.

Next, use React to create an app that displays the kittens from the API. You can use a library like Axios to fetch the data from the API. Your app should show a list of all the kittens at first, and then allow the user to select a specific kitten to see more details about it. While the app is waiting for the API request to finish, display a spinner or placeholder component. Make sure your app looks decent and is somewhat responsive, so it doesn't look terrible on mobile phones.

Finally, put your code on a public Github repository with a README.md file that explains how to run the API and frontend app.

### BONUS
If you're feeling extra ambitious:
-   Dockerize the app
-   Write realistic unit/end-to-end tests to make sure everything is working properly.
